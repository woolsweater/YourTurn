POC for an idea about a display between turns in a multi-player game being played on one screen.

When a player indicates she's done with her move, we don't want her to see the next player's tableau or that player to see hers. So we put up an "interstitial". There's a button with a countdown animation that the original player can tap in case she made a mistake.
